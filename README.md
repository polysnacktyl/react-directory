## Installation
This project was created with React; for guidance on setup and starting, visit [the documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Usage 
On page load, the application performs a GET request from [random-user's API](https://randomuser.me/) and displays a table populated with a hypothetial employee roster displaying a photo, name, email address, and phone numbers for each person. To sort alphabetically by first or last name, simply click "First" or "Last" in the table header.
